Jail TODO 


- More code cleanUp and comment it
- Generate good documentation
- Fix the problem that happens with SSH and Telnet that these
  programs tries to change to the user directory, and due the
  user has a $ in the path (only when you try to change to 
  a directory inside another one) this programs complain about
  this.

  by example:

	test:x:1002:1002:Test,,,:/home/chroot$/home/test:/usr/local/bin/jail

  this will do a chroot in /home/chroot and changes to the 
  directory /home/chroot/home/test, so the user see "/home/test" as
  is home directory. In this case, SSH and Telnet will complain 
  about "/home/chroot$/home/test" doesn't exist. The workarround is
  to make a directory called "/home/chroot$/home/test". We are 
  working on this.

  If you use the plain jail (that is, without split path) Jail runs
  fine.
