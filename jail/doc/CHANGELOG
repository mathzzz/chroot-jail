Current version: 1.9


	VERSION HISTORY
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        1.9		Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD and IRIX platforms are fully
			supported. The perl scripts have been redesigned, so
			a new modular architecture has been adopted. Now, port
			jail to another platform should be an easy task. The
			scripts now do their work better, due the vast 
			majority of the bugs have been fixed. A new debug 
			layer has been added, an all the configuration options
			can be setup from the Makefile, so install jail is
			now quite easy. The mkenv.pl scripts have been renamed
			to mkjailenv, and the other two (addjailuser, addjailsw)
			have lost their extension (.pl).

	1.8		Some improvements has been added to jail. Now it supports
			arguments, so all the argument-based bugs has been fixed,
			also, some programs that depends on this arguments now
			works (ssh, scp). new terminal handling code has been
			added, now jail builds automatically when started the 
			required terminal (tty and pts/XX) device files, and 
			setup their permissions and ownership.


	1.7		Due an error, all the perl scripts have been tested
			in version 1.6 without the -w flag, so they have lot
			of bugs inside. This bugs has been corrected and fixed.
			Another bug fixed is the argument-passing code to the
			strace module, now the programs accept the parameters
			(so the vim problem has been fixed and the script
			addjailsw.pl shouldn't hang when guessing vi. Some
			other minor bugs have been fixed.


	1.6 		The mkenv.sh and addjailuser.sh has been fully 
			rewritten in perl, so they should be more portable, 
			and should fix some bugs that arises when the chroot 
			environment is built. Also, a new application has been 
			written, addjailsw.pl, that allows insert software 
			into the chrooted environment. More flexibility has 
			been archived due mkenv.pl does only the jailed 
			environment. The software installation step is much 
			more clear, and now you can pass arguments to the 
			programs, so in the strace phase the programs can 
			exit nicely, allowing strace do its work. Also,
			in this version you can find some documentation 
			improvements and examples.


        1.5             Fixed a 'not group neither shadow entry bug' in 
		        addjailuser.sh. This is a minor bug. The shadow
			and group entries for the user now are inserted
		 	right in the chrooted environment. 	

        1.4             Removed a bug in jail.c that generates a segmentation
			fault when jail is launched from the shell. Splitted
			mkenv.sh in two programs; mkenv.sh now only builds
			the chrooted environment. addjailuser.sh installs
			new users into the chrooted environment. To install
			a new user under the chrooted environment, this user
			must be created in the system. See INSTALL for more
			details.

	1.3		Removed path splitting, due it is not necesary. Now
			we choose the user directory and its shell from the
			data stored into the /etc/passwd inside the chrooted
			environment. Now the "no such file or directory" bug
			has been removed. (the homedirs in the two passwd 
			files have existing paths)

			mkenv.sh has been fully rewritten, now support the
			different platforms insde it. mkenv.sh supports 
			guessing the right libraries for the files so you
			don't need to know what libraries have to be copied
			into the chrooted environment. Also, mkenv.sh protect
			you for overwritting the customized files (/etc/passwd
			/etc/group and /etc/shadow) so you can have multiple
			users into  a single chrooted environment

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	1.2		Added a new feature, path splitting, so you can have
			multiple users into a single chrooted environment
			(useful for isolate groups of users) The use is simple
			just use: /chroot_dir$/path_relative_to_it 
	
			Added ChangeLog
	
			Added a INSTALL file

			Renamed the mkenv.sh for each platform

			Changed the documentation (section INSTALL and mkenv.sh
			usage)

			Added a TODO file
		
			Added a Mkenv for redhat 6.2

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	1.1		Added a new mkenv.sh for Caldera Linux 7.0
			

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	1.0		Initial release
			Freshmeat Announcement

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
