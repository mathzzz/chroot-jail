SECURITY GUIDE
----------------------------------------------

	Chroot is an approach to get a more secure environment,
	preventing the users to access other directories outside
	the chrooted environment. 



PROCESES
-----------------------------------------------

 	A note about proc filesystem. Mounting proc filesystems
	under a chrooted environment is a security hole, because
	you can access the non chrooted environment just cding
	to the /proc/1/root directory. So by this reason, Jail
	doesn't mount a proc filesystem, so the users under 
	the chroot environment can't access to the process list
	neither to the information under a proc filesystem
