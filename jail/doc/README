Released under GNU Public License v 2.0

INTRODUCTION

	jail is a chrooted environment using bash.
	its main use is to put it as shell for any user you
	want to be chrooted. To work propertly, you have to
	copy some libraries into the chrooted environment, so
	the user have some commands to work :) The environment
	is built using the script 'mkenv.sh' provided in this
	distribution

	In this version, Jail now supports Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD and
	IRIX platform; a new modular design has been applied to the 
	perl scripts, so porting jail to another platform should be 
	an easy task. Also all the options can be setup from the 
	Makefile. A debug layer has been implemented, so if you
	experience some problems, you can activate the debug and 
	create full traces, so I can debug your problem.

	All the scripts have been rewritten, now the vast majority of
	the bugs have been fixed, the dependencies for the programs
	run faster, and overall, all runs better.

INSTALLATION

	See the INSTALL file for details

BUGS

	FIXED: Under IRIX 6.5, the process being killed by itself. After a while
	tracing it, I discover in google that there is a bug in the
	execve() system call.

RELEASE

	This version is 1.9 release. Currently pretty stable.
	The developement was done under a Linux box using debian potato 2.2
	and gcc 2.95.3. 


WARNING

	This version has been tested under linux, solaris, freebsd and irix,
	so if you change your platform, you have to change the scripts and/or
	the c source so the right libraries and files will be copied. 
        If you setup mkenv.sh for another platform, please send it to me, 
	so I put it into the package.
