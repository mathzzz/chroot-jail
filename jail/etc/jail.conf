# Revision 1.1  2004/01/01 18:26:10  assman
# Upgraded version
#
# Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/10/26 09:36:08  assman
# Added support for new platforms: FreeBSD, Solaris, IRIX. Now some options
# can be selected from the Makefile script: DEBUG on/off, install path,
# install permissions, etc. The perl scripts have been rewritten so they
# support platform-specific code, so port Jail to another platform should
# be an easy task.
